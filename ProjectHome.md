HOpS is a tool for simulating the optics of a field of heliostats.  HOpS was developed as part of the RE<C Initiative at Google, focused on developing concentrated solar power.  It was designed to be faster than a raytracer and more accurate and configurable than existing domain-specific tools.

It also contains libraries (in the util directory in the source tree) for efficiently and conveniently manipulating points in different coordinate systems and implementing the mathematical closure of the set of simple polygons with respect to the union, intersection, and subtraction operations.
